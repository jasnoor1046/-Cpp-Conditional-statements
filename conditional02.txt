predict the output
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
 int x=5;
 if(x>3)
  cout<<"Hello";
  cout<<"world";
    return 0;
}
OUTPUT= As the condition is true so the line after if condition will be printed because there are no curly brackets
after 'if' so line directly after it, is considered. so, 'world' is not printed.
